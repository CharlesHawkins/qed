To fix:
- ^Q only deletes one line. Make it able to delete more
- Buffer calls should not print the output resulting from calling the buffer

To implement:
- TABS
- The special buffer control key, ^L
- The quote control-character, ^K
- The re-type and re-edit characters, ^R, ^T, and ^Y
- WRITE OUT
- -c in place of @CONTINUE
